This game was created as a final project for CMU's 53-230: Programming for Game Designers course. *flutter* is a top-down 2D shooter game inspired by roguelikes and shoot-em-up games (such as 20 Minutes Till Dawn) that involve waves of enemies that overwhelm the player. The player can use multiple abilities to clear these enemies and survive the waves. The game is a study in creating games in Unity, understanding gameplay loops, and researching the philosophy behind game design choices.

The ability sprites are drawn by me while many of the other tiles and sprites for the game are from https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods.
